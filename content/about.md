Hi there! I'm Adharsh Kamath. I'm an undergraduate at [NITK, India](https://nitk.ac.in).

This is where I occasionally post [articles](/posts) about Programming Languages, Compilers, Parallel programming and a few other topics.

You can find all my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/adharshkamath/).

I have also started maintaining a list of [projects](/tags/project/) I've worked on/I'm planning to work on. The list is still under construction.

[Reach out](mailto:adharshkamathr@gmail.com) to me if you find any errors in my posts, or if you want to discuss my projects/posts.
